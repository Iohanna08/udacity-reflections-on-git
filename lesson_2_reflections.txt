initializing a repository creates a hidden .git directory for Git
Git needs to be able to track progress, hence the directory
the staging area can contain parts of your working directory that you want to commit
this is important because you might not want to commit all at once
you can use the staging area to have one commit at the time by checking with git diff what the differences are
branches can be helpful for different versions of code, for example different languages or experimental features
diagrams help with the branch structure be letting you see how branches relate to each other
test test for merging
with merging of branches we can update the master branch with any other branch
the commits of the branches are still trace-able (in their merged version)
automatic merging in Git saves a lot of time and prevents typos and other mistakes

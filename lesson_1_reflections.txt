Using diff was faster than manually
diff guarantees everything is checked well
diff can also spot errors you would not have seen otherwise
viewing history can learn what type of errors you are prone to make
viewing history can be helpful when writing new code
manually committing makes a commit more meaningful
automatically can help you when you tend to forget saving your work
saving all files in repository makes it easier to clone the entire repository properly
with git log and git diff you can see the history and the differences between versions
if you can use git commit to revert to older code versions, you can always go back to a working version

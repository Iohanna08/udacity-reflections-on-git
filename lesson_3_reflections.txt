you would want to use a remote repository when you are collaborating with others or when you might be working on different computers
pull manually allows you to choose the moment of getting new code yourself, this is important because automatically receiving new
    code might be hindering your workflow
a fork is a clone on GitHub from another repository that allows you to work on code without changing the original version but it
    also allows for the repositories to still have a link (mainly from clone to the original)
a clone can be a fork, but it can also be a local copy of a repository, in a clone you cannot retrace the original repository
a branch is part of a repository that you can use to work on part of the code without affecting the whole yet, by way of merging
   you can update master or another branch as you progress in your work
if you have a copy of the last known state of the remote locally, you can easily merge back into it without losing parts of branches
without Git/GitHub I would collaborate using some sort of network drive, but it would be much more difficult to follow the workflow
you would want to make changes in a separate branch when you are working on something that is still in its experimental phase
you would want to make changes in the master branch if you aim for accessibility all-around because most people will pull from master
